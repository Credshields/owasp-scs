## Relationships
- CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information  
  [CWE-319 Link](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)

## Description  
Unsecured data transmission refers to the transmission of sensitive information, such as private keys or user data, without encryption. This can lead to:
- Interception of sensitive data by malicious actors.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the contract.
- Loss of funds or data.

## Remediation
- **Use encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data before transmission.
- **Leverage secure protocols:** Use HTTPS or other secure communication protocols.
- **Avoid transmitting sensitive data:** Minimize the transmission of sensitive data whenever possible.

## Examples
- **Unsecured Data Transmission**
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract UnsecuredData {
        function transmitData(bytes memory data) public {
            // Transmit data without encryption
        }
    }
    ```

- **Secured Data Transmission**
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract SecuredData {
        function transmitData(bytes memory encryptedData) public {
            // Transmit encrypted data
        }
    }
    ```
