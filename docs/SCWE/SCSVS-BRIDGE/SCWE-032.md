## Relationships
- CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption  
  [CWE-400 Link](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)

## Description  
Dependency on block gas limit refers to the reliance on the Ethereum block gas limit for contract operations, which can lead to:
- Failed transactions if gas limits are exceeded.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities in gas-intensive operations.
- Loss of funds or data.

## Remediation
- **Optimize gas usage:** Minimize gas consumption in contract operations.
- **Avoid unbounded loops:** Ensure loops have a fixed upper limit.
- **Test thoroughly:** Conduct extensive testing to ensure operations stay within gas limits.

## Examples
- **Gas-Intensive Operation**
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract GasIntensive {
        function processArray(uint[] memory data) public {
            for (uint i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
                // Process each element
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- **Optimized Gas Usage**
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract GasOptimized {
        function processArray(uint[] memory data, uint start, uint end) public {
            require(end <= data.length, "Invalid range");
            for (uint i = start; i < end; i++) {
                // Process each element
            }
        }
    }
    ```
