# Smart Contract Taxonomy

This taxonomy provides a structured framework for understanding and categorizing smart contracts, specifically focusing on EVM-based blockchains and Solidity. It is intended to aid developers, auditors, and researchers in identifying key areas of functionality, associated risks, and best practices for secure development.

- **Key Risks**:  
  - Impermanent loss in AMMs.  
  - Exploitable liquidation mechanics in lending platforms.  
  - Flash loan-based attacks on arbitrage opportunities.

## **6. Escrow and Payment Contracts**  
- **Description**:  
  Contracts managing funds between parties, releasing them based on predefined conditions.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Secure peer-to-peer transactions.  
  - Conditional payments for services or goods.  
- **Key Risks**:  
  - Logic errors leading to incorrect fund releases.  
  - Lack of multi-sig protection in disputes.  
  - Malicious actors exploiting refund or lockup conditions.  

---

## **7. Lottery and Gambling Contracts**  
- **Description**:  
  Contracts providing randomness-based services, such as lotteries or casino games.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Decentralized lotteries.  
  - On-chain games of chance.  
- **Key Risks**:  
  - Manipulation of randomness sources (e.g., block hashes).  
  - Front-running attacks in prize distributions.  
  - Regulatory compliance issues.  

---

## **8. Identity and Access Management**  
- **Description**:  
  Contracts that verify user identities and manage access control.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Decentralized identity solutions (DID).  
  - Role-based access systems in DAOs.  
- **Key Risks**:  
  - Unauthorized privilege escalation.  
  - Mishandling of sensitive user data.  

---

## **9. Bridge Contracts**  
### Examples: Cross-chain bridges  
- **Description**:  
  Contracts facilitating asset or data transfers between blockchains.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Bridging tokens across L1s and L2s (e.g., Ethereum â†” Arbitrum).  
  - Enabling interoperability between blockchains.  
- **Key Risks**:  
  - Replay attacks.  
  - Exploits in validator or relayer systems.  
  - Loss of funds during cross-chain transfers.  

---

## **10. Supply Chain and Logistics Contracts**  
- **Description**:  
  Contracts managing supply chain operations or tracking logistics.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Verifying product authenticity.  
  - Tracking shipments across supply chains.  
- **Key Risks**:  
  - Dependence on external data integrity.  
  - Incorrect implementation of audit trails.  

---

## **11. Gaming and Metaverse Contracts**
